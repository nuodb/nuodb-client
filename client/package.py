# Base class for creating a package in nuodb-client.
# Each component in the client package should define a subclass of Package
# and override the methods necessary to add that component into the package.
#
# The steps in building a package are as follows:
#    prereqs()       : Set up any prerequisite packages
#    download()      : Download the third party package
#    validate()      : Validate the download
#    unpack()        : Unpack the downloaded content package
#    patch()         : Apply local patches to the package
#    test()          : Test the package
#    install()       : Install the package
#
#    clean()         : Clean the package
